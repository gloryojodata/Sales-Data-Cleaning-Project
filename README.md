# Ecommerce Sales Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my data cleaning and preparation skills using a real-world ecommerce sales dataset.

The raw dataset contained several data quality issues that required cleaning before analysis could be performed.

## Dataset Problems

The original dataset contained:

- Duplicate records
- Missing values
- Inconsistent formatting
- Extra spaces
- Incorrect data formats

## Cleaning Process

Using Microsoft Excel, I performed the following steps:

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values
- Standardized column formats
- Removed extra spaces
- Ensured data consistency
- Created pivot tables for validation
